# StartUp

After starting HBuilderX for the first time, you will see a selection window where you can select your favorite `theme` and `shortcut keys`.

After clicking the [Start Experience] button, you will see a "Readme", which briefly introduces the features of HBuilderX. Click the `x` on the tab to close this file.

To experience HBuilderX, start with a new project.
