#### Keep close or same shortcut

For example, shortcut of tabs are the same as those of the browser, `command+t` to open new tab,`command+shift+t` to restore closed tab,  `command+w` to close tab, `command+alt+left/right` to switch tabs.

Users who are used to searching for files with `command+t` in the eclipse, remember that the shortcut key for searching files has been changed to `command+p`.

#### command is an action、command+shift is the opposite action、command+alt is for more actions

`command+k` to format，`command+shift+k` to join lines

`command+w` to close current tab，`command+shift+w` to close all tabs

`command+f` to search file，`command+alt+f` to search file in selected directory

#### Symbolize rather than letterize

It's hard to remember shortcut for action "surround" with a letter.

`command+]` is surround，`command+shift+]` is anti-surround. It's much easy to remember with symbol.

`command+shift+|` is to set a cursor for the selected row, "|" can be regarded as a cursor.

- `alt+mouse wheel` is horizontal scrolling
- `alt+mouse single-click` is goto definition
- `alt+mouse drag`is column selection
