# How HBuilderX look after programmer’s health mentally and physically

Everybody knows ergonomics. However, do you know there is a strong relationship between and IDE and programmer?

The answer is yes for sure. There is a strong relationship between health of your body parts, for example, eyes and hands, and so on, and IDE.

DCloud is an ingenious and sentimental company. A company contributes a lot of energy and effort and money on researching the relationship between IDE and human health mentally and physically.


### Easy on the eyes: user friendly theme

A lot of people think “black” is a colour which easy on your eyes. Even we were using the “black” theme for a while. However, the consequences are not great. Thus, we start put a lot of effort on research which theme is easy on user’s eyes.

By referencing the E-book industry, the background colour shall NOT be a “black”, particularly if you stare at the monitor or mobile screen for a long period of time. It shall be a yellowish colour. Eventually the reader is giving up the E-book provider, if it uses “black” as the background colour for E-books.

Why is the yellowish background colour E-book widely implemented in the industry? Is it because it provides reader a wrong impression with reading a real book? Or it is a scientific truth. We need to study carefully.

There is a say that the black background emits less light in LCD, so it is easy on the eyes. In fact, the background colour of lot of IDEs is not pure black due to the pure black as background colour is ugly. The particles on the LCD panel are still glowing. Although the amount of light in the dark area of the LCD panel is low, in terms of the tension of the human eye muscles, the damage of high contrast is greater than the amount of light emitted. On the sunny grassland, although the amount of light is very large, the human eye is very comfortable. But in a black room, the brightness of the mobile phone screen is adjusted to the lowest, and the amount of light is much lower than the former, but it is still dazzling. This is caused by the effect of contrast.


In HBuilderX, the default theme is light green. It is characterized by softness, low contrast, clearness under strong light, and a strong sense of green. A programmer writes a code for a day or two using light green theme is much more comfortable than using a background that is too bright or too dark.

The light green is a decision based on a rigorous design process. It involves a lot of knowledge of colour psychology and colour physiology. We have undergone rigorous medical tests in Beijing Guo’ao psychology hospital. Human trial on programmers who write the code using different colour themes. Then their brain fatigue level is recorded in the hospital. Finally, an adjusted light green colour scheme is determined. The experimental process is as follows:

> After a full rest, the two programmers participating in the experiment used programming tools with green and black themes to code for half an hour. And their brain wave data changes are monitored. 
> Through the analysis of 170,000 pieces of data generated by the experimenter’s brain waves, using the fatigue value, tension and concentration of attention values printed by the hospital equipment, the conclusion of the experiment is as follows:
> The fatigue level of the two programmers is both increase after half an hour of coding. However, the fatigue level of programmers working using the light green theme increases relatively slowly. The degree of tension is lower, and the two programmers are more focused during the same period of time.
> The increase in fatigue value after using the black theme coding is as high as 700% of the increase in using the light green theme! 
> This kind of experiment has been carried out many times with changing the scenarios, and the conclusion is always the same.

Firstly, let’s look at the issue for black theme from the perspective of colour and chromatology:

1. `Vertigo`
When a person's eyes look at dark things for a long time, the brain will secrete hormones to force the eyes to enhance vision. 
For example, we can see clearly when we stay in a dark room for a while, but we get dizzy when we return to a sunny area. This is called scotopia. 
Similarly, if you look at the black background code area for a long time, you will be dizzy when you switch to other software interfaces or look out of the window.

2. `Congenital night blindness`
The eyeball secretes rhodopsin, which consumes vitamin A. And it can cause night blindness. Although it is not myopia, a person’s night vision is lower than that of ordinary people.
Refer to[Baidu rhodopsin](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%A7%86%E7%B4%AB%E7%BA%A2%E8%B4%A8)

3. `High contrast`
Black backgrounds often correspond to high-contrast foreground content. However, the high-contrast environment is not suitable for long-term viewing. 
In fact, it's like you can't eat a lot of sugar or spicy food, but you can drink a lot of water. 
A mild image may not be able to maintain sufficient clarity under strong light or poor eyesight. We repeatedly adjust the parameters to get the current results – light green.

After many researches, the Yellow and green is the favorited colours for human eyes.
The wavelengths of yellow and green are most comfortable feel which human eyes like the most.
Light green background is warm yellow. User interfaces add a bit green. The code is colourful.  Remember that all colour RGB in which G is the value for green.

In addition, from the perspective of color psychology, warm colors are more comfortable than dark colors. 
The human eye sees the scenery, the brain will produce associations, and then affect the mood.
When you see green, you are thinking of grassland and forest. Then you feel much better naturally.
But looking at dark or irritating colors for a long time, your mood will be depressed.
For a programmer, if you stare at the screen eight hours a day, it is important to feel comfortable.

For millions of developers, we must work hard to study how to protect their health. 
After many theories and experiments, we finally figure out the light green theme.

The design principle of some products is shining first. HX is not. It is health the first. Maybe the HX is not the most beautiful IDE, however, indeed it must be the healthiest IDE.

### Healthy hands：Drag-free selection to protect finger joints and nerves

Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI) is very common for a programmer. Do you know what is the most severe strain during mouse operation? The answer is drag.

The drag selection process is like this: the index finger presses the left mouse button. The nerves remain tense. Then you move the wrist to drive the mouse to move. After select the content you want, and you can release the index finger. During this process, the index finger keeps pressing down. The muscles and nerves in your hands are always in a tight state.

It’s more painful if you use the touchpad.

Occasionally drag is not a big deal. However, after eight hours programming day in day out, the Repetitive Strain Injuries is caused by the drag selection.

In order to avoid drag selection, HX give you smart hotkeys, smart auto selection on double click, smart hotkeys that work even without selection, and a sort of capabilities.

- smart hotkeys
`Ctrl+=`is from the cursor point to expend the selection. `Ctrl+E`is select the current word or select the same words. There are lot more smart hotkeys selection. Please refer to manual – Selection

- smart auto selection on double click
give you the different results on double-click in several scenarios. User can double-click at the beginning of the line, end of line, function block, equal sign, comma, hyphen, brackets, quotation mark, first character at the beginning of the line, <!-- -->, and other special syntax symbols to quickly select the corresponding content. 
Mastering this set of intelligent double-click technics can greatly improve operation efficiency and reduce hand strain. 
Especially smart double-click the list, see menu selection. It is strongly recommended to study and master the smart double-click carefully.

- smart hotkeys that work even without selection
If you select nothing, Ctrl+C is copy,Ctrl+X is cut. You also can do the same operation on the entire line cursor located.
`Ctrl+Insert`is paste the selection. `Ctrl+Shift+X`is Switchover selections.There are more capabilities HX can provided to user. User can operate on the cursor line as well.
`Ctrl+D` is delete the entire line.`Ctrl+up/down`is move the line. `Shift+Del`delete the line. All the operations above is without selection.

Please refer to manual - Edit for more functionalities.  


As a company providing the service to programmer, especially we are the developer as well, efficiency and healthy is a key to us.

It is our wish that all developers are working more efficiently and healthier by using HX.
