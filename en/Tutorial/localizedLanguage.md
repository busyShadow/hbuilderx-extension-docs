# HBuilderX Localized Language

Supported from HBuilderX 3.2.9+

You can switch language between `English` and `Chinese Traditional`.

You can also `make your own` languages, such as Japanese, Korean, and French.

## Switch Language

When you start HBuilderX for the first time, HBuilderX will display the language consistent with your `operating system language`; for example, if your operating system is English, HBuilderX will display English.

You can manually switch the language, click on the top menu of HBuilderX [Tools-Appearance Language].

## Contribute Translation

If you want to contribute to the HBuilderX project, please submit a pull request to this repository, and we will merge the revised content into the language package after inspection and review.

- The Chinese content will be released together with the installation package, usually the next installation package will contain the modified content.
- Other language packsâ€‹will be published to the related language pack according to specific time.

## Make HBuilderX language pack

If you do not find a localized language pack, I suggest you develop a localized language pack by yourself or with other developers.
