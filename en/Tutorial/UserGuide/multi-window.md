Regarding multi-windows, two concepts need to be understood: `main Window`, `Single Project Window`

## Single Project Window

**main Window**:  The project manager can display multiple project lists.

**Single Project Window**: It is the project manager, which only displays one project.

- Single Project Window: the title of the form will display: Single Project Window
- The opened single-project window list will be displayed in the menu [View]
- Menu [File] [Open Multi-Window Project], you can open the historical single-project window.


## Create Single Project Window 

On the main form, click the menu [View] [New Window] to create a new Single Project Window .

On the main form, select an item, right-click on the menu, and click [Open in New Window] to open the item in the Single Project Window.
