## One-click sharing

When you add images to an md file, it is difficult to manage these images without online server because the md file only accepts image links.

HBuilderX provides markdown one-click sharing feature with [uniCloud](https://unicloud.dcloud.net.cn/). It is a simple, secure, stable and free cloud platform.

With the one-click sharing feature, you can upload markdown documents to uCloud in HBuilderX and return a url that can be shared. At the same time, the images involved in markdown will also be automatically uploaded to uCloud. This feature is completely free.

## Onedrive Sync

# Onedrive

Firstly, recommend a cloud synchronisaion tool - microsoft onedrive https://skydrive.live.com/

After dropbox is blocked, onedrive becomes the best choice because it is free, stable, safe and cross-platform.

Onedrive is build-in in windows 10. It also can be downloaded from above link for other platforms. (It is important to install the onedriver client software, or use VPN for web version) .

Setup an onedrive account. A onedrive folder will be created in your PC. Create a folder. The folder name can be anything, for example. "notes". The md file written by HBuilderX can be saved in it.

When the md file is saved in HBuilderX, it will also be synchronized to onedrive. This file will also be synced when you log in to other devices.

onedrive app in mobile do not support open markdown. For iOS, mweb is recommended. For Android, Hammer notes is recommended.

# Sync to svn and git

After install node, once the file is changed, watch will commit to svn and git.

To do list for a team can be synchronised in this way.

In DCloud, we use the first method. Co-working Files is using the second method. 

svn and git are more suitable for PC users to modify and view on the mobile. HBuilderX+markdown provides a better experience than Evernote and OneNote. Start quickly. Efficient editing and User-friendly for reading.

However, Onedrive is a better solution for frequent editing.

HBuilderX will provide an excellent Markdown editing experience.
