## One-click sharing

Markdown has a fascinating input experience, but it is not convenient to share, especially the lack of free, stable, and high-speed image beds.
[uniCloud](https://unicloud.dcloud.net.cn/) provides a free, stable, high-speed server and CDN.
HBuilderX, based on uniCloud, provides one-click sharing of markdown.

Use uniCloud's front-end web hosting to stably convert markdown into HTML web pages and publish them as online URLs. You can send the URL to anyone who wants to share.
At the same time, the pictures involved in markdown will also be automatically uploaded to the free CDN in the front-end web hosting.

## Onedrive Synchronisation

# Onedrive

Firstly, recommend a cloud synchronisaion tool - microsoft onedrive https://skydrive.live.com/

After the dropbox is blocked, onedrive becomes the best, free, secure tool supporting all platforms.

Onedrive is buildin in windows 10 OS. It can be downloaded from above link for other platforms. (It is important to install the client software, the web version still need jarbreak.

Register an onedrive account. onedrive folder is created in your PC. Create a folder. Folder name can be any, eg. "note". md files writen by HBuilderX can be saved in it. 

Evertime when file is saved in HBuilderX, it also sychronized in onedrive.

If you login another devides, eg PC or mobile, the file is there.

onedrive app in mobile do not support open markdown directly. mweb is recommended. If android, hummer notes is recommended.

# svn and git

After install node, once the file is changed, watch will commit in svn and git.

A to do list for a team can be synchronised in this way.

In DCloud, we use the first method. Co-working Files is using the second method. 

svn and git more suitable for PC user modify and view in mobile. HBuilderX+markdown provide a better solution as evernote and Onenote. Fast startup. Efficient editing. User-friendly user interface for reading.

However, if editing is always required in mobile app, Onedrive is a better solution.

The more drama and short video, the more stupid you will be.

Open HBuilderX, the more markdown writing, the smarter you will be.
