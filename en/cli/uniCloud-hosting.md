# Frontend Web Hosting

The front-end web hosting is based on the ability of uniCloud to provide developers with faster, safer, more worry-free, and cheaper website publishing for developers' html web pages.

- Faster: Without going through the web server, the pages and resources are directly uploaded to the CDN, which can be accessed nearby, and the speed is faster.
- Safer: There are no vulnerabilities in the various operating systems and web servers of traditional servers, so there is no need to think about patching every day. A service that will never be defeated without fear of DDoS attacks.
- More worry-free: no need to buy virtual machines, install operating systems, configure web servers, handle load balancing, handle large concurrency, handle DDoS attacks... You donâ€™t have to worry about anything, just upload the page files you write
- Cheaper: uniCloud is launched by DCloud in conjunction with Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Cloud, and the Alibaba Cloud version is completely free.
